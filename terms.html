  <h1>Website Terms & Conditions</h1>

  <h2>🛡️ Website Responsibility Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    LightSource Digital is not responsible for websites that fall out of date or become vulnerable due to lack of maintenance. Clients are expected to keep their site software, themes, and plugins up to date. Failure to do so may result in security vulnerabilities or performance issues. For those who prefer a hands-off approach, a maintenance & security plan is available upon request.
  </p>

  <h2>🔧 Maintenance & Support Policy</h2>
  <p>
    LightSource Digital offers optional recurring services such as plugin updates, malware scans, backups, and performance monitoring. These are not included in one-time design projects unless a recurring plan is signed.

    <li>Report technical issues within 7 days of final delivery</li>
    <li>Install only verified and reputable third-party plugins</li>

    <li>LightSource Digital retains rights to templates or tools used, unless agreed upon</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🚫 Refund Policy</h2>

    LightSource Digital is not liable for losses from outdated software, site misuse, hosting/server issues, or third-party plugin vulnerabilities.
